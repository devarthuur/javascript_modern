# css-extract-plugin

## The concept (yet not implemented!)

The plugin extracts CSS into separate files and remove generated by webpack empty javascript files.

The purpose of this plugin is to do the same as these plugins:

- [`mini-css-extract-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin)
- [`webpack-remove-empty-scripts`](https://github.com/webdiscus/webpack-remove-empty-scripts)

This plugin is replacement of these two plugins, **2 in 1**, do it more **efficient** and much **faster**.

The `webpack-remove-empty-scripts` plugin is a hard addon for the` mini-css-extract-plugin` to fix bug/feature in webpack.
It needed extra CPU und RAM resources. Webpack built resources slower than could be,
because must do needless steps which we can spare if do it at same steps in one plugin.

## What do we have now

webpack.config.js
```js
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
const RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin = require('webpack-remove-empty-scripts');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    'styles': ['./styles.css']
  },
  plugins: [
    new RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin(),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: '[name].[chunkhash:8].css',
    })
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 
          'css-loader'
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```


## What will we have.

webpack.config.js
```js
const CssExtractPlugin = require('css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    'styles': ['./styles.css']
  },
  plugins: [
    new CssExtractPlugin({
      filename: '[name].[chunkhash:8].css',
    })
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: [
          CssExtractPlugin.loader, 
          'css-loader'
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Feel the difference.

The plugin `css-extract-plugin` will do same as `mini-css-extract-plugin` + `webpack-remove-empty-scripts`, but much faster.

## Why?

- I will do this plugin for my projects.
- I will save build time.
- I know how do this plugin more efficient than these both.
